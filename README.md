# Split Bullet: Core
This repository is the source for ``Split Bullet: Core``'s Workshop addon.

Split Bullet: Core contains basic gamemode functionality for Split Bullet, a 2.5-dimensional shooter. This is not intended to be a playable gamemode.

This should be cloned into an addon folder, usually ``addons/splitbullet_core/`` works best when uploading with GMAD to the Workshop.
